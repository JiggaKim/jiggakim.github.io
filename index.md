## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
Lab 1 Part 1

 Lab 1 introduced coding to me and it helped me to understand what I was gonna learn.
 Even though the only thing really done is putting our names in the authors file and 
 adding only a little bit of code, it gave me a starting point. Without the starting point of 
 using code like cout, I would never be able to get where I am today. 

Lab 2 Part 1

 Lab 2 continued on the understanding of how to use cout and cin. This was very 
 important to me because helped me understand how to print out messages without any 
 errors. It was a great lab to help me practice for future labs. 

Lab 7 Part 1

 Lab 7 was a lab where we had to use bool and lots of if statements. This lab was pretty 
 challenging due to how much if statements we had to implement and trying to 
 differentiate between “and” and “or”. Even though it was somewhat challenging, it was 
 fun nonetheless.
